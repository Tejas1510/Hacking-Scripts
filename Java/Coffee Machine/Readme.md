We will be using these menus for the program. Since it is an user input friendly program so users will choose one from them, lets choose buy first.After the input "buy" the users 
will be asked for which type of coffee.And if the machine has enough ingredients to make that user's coffee then message will be displayed `The Coffee is being ready!` and if the 
machine has not enough ingredients to make user's coffee then message will be displayed what type of ingredients it haven't or less than need.
