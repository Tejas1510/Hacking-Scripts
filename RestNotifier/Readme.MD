## Rest Notifier in Python

### What is Rest Notifier ?
``` It is a simple python script which prompts you to take break after certain period of time so as to relax yourself
Here you can give the amount of time after you want the break and no of breaks you want.
Moreover you can even change the song you like.
```


### Introduction
```
A lot of us suffer from backpain, eye-strain, and other related problems while working for longer hours without taking any breaks. So I spent some minutes writing a Python script that reminds us to take a break after a specified amount of time as entered by the user with minimum being 1 min. As a reminder, it plays your favorite song if you wish to do so.

The module i have used are webbrowser and Time.
```



### Code

### Step 1: Import Required Module
```
import webbrowser
import time
```
### Step 2: Run the code :
```
cd RestNotifier
python notifier.py
```
### Output
```When you run the file you will be asked about number of break and the time in Minutes after you want the breaks
The minimum min you need to enter is 1
Then after specific amount of time you will be redirected to a relaxation song if you select Y else a message will be displayed.
