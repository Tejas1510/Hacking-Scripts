# 21 Number Game
This is a simple 21 number game using Python programming language. The game illustrated here is between the player and the computer. There can be many variations in the game.

## Rule of the game :- 
  `1` The player can choose his/her preferences that whether he/she can play first or second.<br/>
  `2` There will be always showing list of numbers before the player takes his turn.<br/>
  `3` if player chooses first chance then he/she can only input the numbers between 0 and 4.<br/>
  `4` if player chooses second chance then he/she can input the numbers but it is prefer to input the numbers between 0 and 4.<br/>
  `5` <b> Most important rule :- </b> player will only input the values in consecutive numbers like (2,3,4,5...)<br/>
  `6` If consecutive numbers are not given in input then the player is automatically disqualified.<br/>
  `7` The player loses if he gets the chance to call 21 and wins otherwise.
  
## Secret to win the game:-
  	if player choose second chance then he/she can win.
