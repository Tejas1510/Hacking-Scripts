# Air Quality Detector
## Introduction
Here we will fetch the air quality index using api and extracting it through json and request and then showing the result through tkinter.Here it will also show whether it is good or bad.
## Third-Party Libraries Required :
->json
->requests

## How to install the above Library
pip install requests
pip install tkinter
pip install json

## How to use it :
Here for the usage of api we need to generate a api key from the website and then we just need to specify the city name for which we need to fetch data in the script and then output will be shown.
