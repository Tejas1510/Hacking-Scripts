# MasterMind Game
Mastermind is an old code-breaking game played by two players. The game goes back to the 19th century and can be played with paper and pencil.

## Rule of the game :- 
`1` Player 1 plays first by setting a 4-digit number.<br/>
`2` Player 2 now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.<br/>
`3` If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Player 1 hints by revealing which 
    digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.<br/>
`4` The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.<br/>
`5` Now, Player 2 gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.<br/>
`6` If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastermind.<br/>
`7` If not, then Player 2 wins the game.<br/>
