# E-Dictionary
### About
This script is made using Python 3 and is used to find the meaning, synonyms and antonyms of the word, taken as input from the user.

### How It Works ?
I'm using [PyDictionary](https://pypi.org/project/PyDictionary/) module/package which is a 'real' Dictionary Module for Python 2/3 to get meanings, translations, synonyms and Antonyms of words.<br>
It uses WordNet for getting meanings, Google for translations, and synonym.com for getting synonyms and antonyms and therefore, **internet connectivity is required** for this script to run properly.
The module uses Python Requests, BeautifulSoup4 and goslate as dependencies.

### Setup
*   Download and install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org).
*   Run `pip install PyDictionary` in your terminal/CMD to install the package in your system. (Or `pip3 install PyDictionary` if you have Python 2 & 3 installed)
*   Download and save the script.
*   Navigate to where you have saved it and open a terminal there.
*   Run `python e-dictionary.py` in your terminal or `python3 e-dictionary.py` if you have Python 2 installed as well.
*   Enter the word you want to find the meaning of and you're done.
*   Some Input/Output examples:

*   NOTE: The script will show error and exit, if no meaning of the word is found.
