Third-Party Libraries Required :

We just need to understand the script and then run so a screen having hidden cards will pop and we have to find 2 cards having same symbol at a time otherwise it will flip , so we have to just solve this puzzle.
This game is about memory firstly we have to draw a random card and then search for that card from another if we found then we have to serch for another pair and we have to continue till last pair and then finally ends when we get all the pairs
