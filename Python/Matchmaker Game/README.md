Title of the Project: #Matchmaker Game

Introduction: Here we had made a game in which all cards are hidden if we can find 2 cards having same symbol at a time then only the cards will unhide. For this game we will use random ,tkinter ,time library.

Third-Party Libraries Required :
tkinter , random ,time

How to install the above Library
pip install tkinter
pip install random


How to use it :
We just need to understand the script and then run so a screen having hidden cards will pop and we have to find 2 cards having same symbol at a time otherwise it will flip , so we have to just solve this puzzle.
This game is about memory firstly we have to draw a random card and then search for that card from another if we found then we have to serch for another pair and we have to continue till last pair and then finally ends when we get all the pairs
