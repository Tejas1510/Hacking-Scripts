# Dice Game With Bot

## Introduction:
Here we write a python script using random, time library in which firstly we would be ask how many times you want to play and then random result will be generated for bot and then it will compare with us and then again ask if you want to play again and not then game ends and result will be declared.

## Third-Party Libraries Required :
time , random
## How to install the above Library
pip install random
pip install time

## How to use it :
Here we just need to run the script then we need to give the number of times we need to play as input so random ouput of both human and bot will be generated and result will be shown ans atlast it will ask if you want to play again or not.
