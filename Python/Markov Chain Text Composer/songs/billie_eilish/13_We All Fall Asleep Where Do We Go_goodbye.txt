[Intro]
Please, please
Don't leave﻿ me
Be

[Verse]
It's not true
Take me to the rooftop
Told you not to worry
What do you want from me?
Don't ask questions
Wait a minute
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go ﻿to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about them?
I'm the bad guy
