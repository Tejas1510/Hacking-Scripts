[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Etta James]
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

[Instrumental]
